### Requirements/Assumptions
While previous modding experience is not necessary for this document, you are expected to be knowledgable on basic computer functions. This document will require:
* The Steam edition of SSE
* Windows 7 or higher (64-bit)
* A text editor (Notepad or Notepad++)
* [Microsoft VC++ 2015-2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-GB/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) (x86 and x64)

## Preparations 
This section will teach you how to prepare SSE for modding.

Before adding any mods to your game, you will need to do the following:
1. Install SSE outside of a Windows protected folder (Program Files, Program Files (x86), etc.).
2. Setup a Nexus Account.
3. Download and install Mod Organizer 2.


### Setting up Skyrim Special Edition
You will need to ensure that your copy of SSE is outside of a Windows protected folder. Windows is very protective when you try to edit anything inside of it.

#### Moving your Steam Directory
By default, your Steam directory will be placed in:

**C:\Program Files(x86)\Steam\SteamApps\Common**

To move your Steam directory:

1. In your Steam client, click **Steam** > **Settings**.
